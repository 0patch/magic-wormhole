# on windows, trial is installed as venv/bin/trial.py, not .exe, but (at
# least appveyor) adds .PY to $PATHEXT. So "trial wormhole" might work on
# windows, and certainly does on unix. To get "coverage run" to work, we need
# a script name (since "python -m twisted.scripts.trial" doesn't have a 'if
# __name__ == "__main__": run()' -style clause). The script name will vary on
# the platform.

# There's a bug in Twisted-15.5.0 (#8014, fixed in trunk) that manifests as
# various intermittent magic-wormhole test failures that always include
# twisted.internet.endpoints "iterateEndpoint" or "checkDone". It's a race
# condition, and for some reason it mostly shows up on python3.3 . So run the
# py33 build with a copy of Twisted from git 'trunk' until Twisted-16.0.0 is
# released and we can just depend on that.
